# Weekend-jQuery-Salary-Calculator

Our Goals in this project:

We needed to make a form that took in, through a 'submit' button, employee information: First and Last Name, ID Number, Job Title, and Annual Salary. 

With this information, stored on a table, we needed to show what the monthly budget to pay the current group of employees. If the number hit $20,000 or more, we needed to turn the budget red.

During this assignment we needed to:
<ul>
  <li>make and clear fields</li>
  <li>make working 'submit' and 'delete' buttons</li> 
  <li>get the monthly salary</li>
  <li>add all monthly salaries togther and display that total on the DOM</li>
  <li>target an element on the DOM to turn it red.</li>
</ul>
